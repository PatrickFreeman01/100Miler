My first 100 mile bike ride
This is a map of my early pandemic hobby of cycling. Me and some friends went on a 100 mile bike ride one day. This is the route that we took
I think all of the main functions came during the process of adding my geoJson file to the map along with the point features. I had four points which signified my starting and stoping point in "Johns House" and the three breaks that we took along the ride.
I used the Esri World Street Map off of leafelt provider as my basemap
I got my GPX file from strava and converted that into geoJson
